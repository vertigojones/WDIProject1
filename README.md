Hangman game: 

Hangman is a web-based game where the player tries to work out a secret word by guessing all letters that are included.
Starting out with an empty array, the object of the game is to fill out all blanks with the correct letters for each character. 
If the guessed letter is in the secret word, then the letter will appear in the correct position(s) on the array. 
If the guessed letter is not in the secret word, then the player will have to guess again.
The game will end when the player has guessed all letters correctly, or has guessed six incorrect letters.
