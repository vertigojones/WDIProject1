Trumpisms™ game:

Trumpisms™ is based on the classic hangman game.
Try and guess the word that he once made up (unintentionally).
If you guess a letter correctly, you won't be seeing anything of The Donald.
If you guess a letter incorrectly, Trump will insult you and start to appear.
Don't guess too many incorrect letters or he will FIRE YOU!!!
