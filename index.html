        <h2>Instructions:</h2>

        <p>Trumpisms is a web-based hangman game where the player tries to work out a secret word by guessing all letters that are included.</br>
            Starting out with an empty array, the object of the game is to fill out all blanks with the correct letters for each character.</br>
            If the guessed letter is in the secret word, then the letter will appear in the correct position(s) on the array.</br>
            If the guessed letter is not in the secret word, then the player will have to guess again.</br> The game will
            end when the player has guessed all letters correctly, or has guessed six incorrect letters.</br>
            Good luck!</p>
